This is our collection of [reusable GitHub Actions workflows](https://resources.github.com/learn/pathways/automation/intermediate/create-reusable-workflows-in-github-actions/). They are designed to be used across multiple repositories to ensure consistency and reduce duplication.

The configuration of this repo is managed by OpenTofu in [estate-repos](https://github.com/evoteum/estate-repos).

Callable workflow are located in the `.github/workflows` directory. To use them in your repository, copy corresponding workflow in the `callers` directory to your repository's `.github/workflows` directory.

Callers are the minimal workflows that call the reusable workflows. They are designed to be copied into your repository and should not be modified, other than input parameters.

Our [estate-repos](https://github.com/evoteum/estate-repos) can be used to create new repositories with these workflows already included.

## Usage
[//]: # (REQUIRED)
[//]: # (Explain what the thing does. Use screenshots and/or videos.)

Simply copy the caller workflow from the `callers` directory to your repository's `.github/workflows` directory. You can then modify the input parameters to suit your needs.
